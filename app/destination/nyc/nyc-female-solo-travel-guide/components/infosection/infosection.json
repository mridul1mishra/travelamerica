            "New York City is one of the safest major cities in the United States, especially in well‑traveled areas like Midtown, the Upper West Side, Brooklyn Heights, and DUMBO. For solo female travelers, NYC offers independence, convenience, and constant activity — but it also requires awareness, especially at night and on the subway.", "This guide focuses on real NYC situations: navigating crowded streets, handling unwanted attention, riding the subway late at night, and choosing safe neighborhoods to stay in. No fear-based warnings — just practical, scenario-based strategies tailored to how the city actually works.", "Whether you're exploring museums, walking through Manhattan, or taking the subway after dinner, the goal is simple: stay confident, stay aware, and know what to do if something feels off."
